   <h1>About Me</h1>
   <h2>Hi, I'm a Full Stack Developer with a passion for building scalable web applications and clean, efficient code. I specialize in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), combined with strong proficiency in Python for backend development, automation, and data-driven applications.

With experience across both front-end and back-end technologies, I enjoy crafting responsive user interfaces, developing robust APIs, and deploying full-stack solutions that solve real-world problems. Whether itâ€™s building RESTful services, integrating third-party APIs, or creating seamless user experiences, I bring a balance of creativity and logic to every project.

I'm always exploring new tools and frameworks to stay current in the ever-evolving tech landscape. My goal is to keep learning, build meaningful software, and contribute to impactful projects.
